        RCN is a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol that persons can use to create and fund digital assets’ loan requests. The RCN protocol is made up of free, public, open-source or source-available software including a set of smart contracts that are deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain. Your use of the RCN protocol involves various risks including, but not limited to, bugs and errors in the code and default from borrowers and/or cosigners.
        <br>
        Before using the RCN protocol, you should review the relevant documentation to make sure you understand how the RCN protocol works. You may, as well, access the RCN protocol through a variety of web or mobile interfaces. You are responsible for doing your own diligence on those interfaces to understand the risks they present, and fees and costs that may be involved.
        <br>
        AS DESCRIBED IN THE RELEVANT RCN PROTOCOL LICENSES, THE RCN PROTOCOL IS PROVIDED ”AS IS”, AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. You should not use the RCN protocol or any of its web or mobile interfaces if they are or could be subject to any regulations or authorizations in your jurisdiction.
        <br>
        Although Ripio International and/or its affiliates (hereinafter, “Ripio”) developed much of the initial code for the RCN protocol, they do not control the RCN protocol, which is run by smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and may be substantially modified and copied by developers unassociated with Ripio.
        <br>
        By interacting with the RCN protocol directly or through any web or mobile interface, you agree that no developer or entity involved in creating or updating the RCN protocol nor Ripio will be liable for any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use, or your interaction with other users of, the RCN protocol, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or loss of profits, cryptocurrencies, tokens, or anything else of value.
